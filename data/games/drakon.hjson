  description: You have been caught looting the hoard of the dreaded Drakon. For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response â€” but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.
