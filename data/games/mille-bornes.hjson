{
  name: Milles Bornes
  description: In most of Europe (especially in France), along the roads, one sees small monuments of cement at regular intervals, bearing a figure and the name of a town. They are the kilometer-stones (in French: Bornes Kilometriques â€“ in English: milestones), well known to motorists. They show the number of the route as well as the distance to the next town. The red or yellow color of these stones indicate whether the route is a national highway or a local road. These are the markers which give this game its name: Mille Bornes (pronounced "meel born"). This is a card game for 2, 3, 4, or 6 players, usually played by 4 players, 2 on each team, as a partnership game. Therefore, the game will be described first in this form. Slight variations necessary for other numbers of players will be noted later.
