  name: Spikeball
  description: Spikeball is a new sport that's sweeping the nation. It's commonly referred to as the love child between volleyball and four-square. It is played 2 vs 2, with a taut hula hoop sized Spikeball net placed between the teams.  A player starts a point by serving the ball down on the net so it ricochets up at his opponents.  They have up to three hits between them (just like Volleyball) to control the ball and bounce it back off the net.
