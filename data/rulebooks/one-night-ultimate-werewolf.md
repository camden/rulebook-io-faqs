glossary:
  - name: Villager
    definition: |
      The Villager has no special abilities, but he is definitely not a werewolf. Players may often claim to be a Villager. **The Villager is on the village team.**

  - name: Werewolf
    matches: 
      - werewolf
      - werewolves
    definition: |
      At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves. If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center. **Werewolves are on the werewolf team.**

  - name: Seer
    definition: |
      At night, the Seer may look either at one other player’s card or at two of the center cards, but does not move them. **The Seer is on the village team.**

  - name: Robber
    definition: |
      At night, the Robber may choose to rob a card from another player and place his Robber card where the other card was. Then the Robber looks at his new card. The player who receives the Robber card is on the village team. **The Robber is on the team of the card he takes**, however, he does not do the action of his new role at night.

  - name: Troublemaker
    definition: |
      At night, the Troublemaker may switch the cards of two **other** players without looking at those cards. The players who receive a different card are now the role (and team) of their new card, even though they don’t know what role that is until the end of the game. **The Troublemaker is on the village team.**

  - name: Tanner
    definition: |
      The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die. The Tanner only wins if he dies. If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do not win. If the Tanner dies and a Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too. The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses. **The Tanner is not on the werewolf or the villager team.**

  - name: Drunk
    definition: |
      The Drunk is so drunk that he doesn’t remember his role. When it comes time to wake up at night, he must exchange his Drunk card for any card in the center, but he does not look at it. The Drunk is now the new role in front of him (even though he doesn’t know what that new role is) and is on that team.

  - name: Hunter
    definition: |
      If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes his target receives). **The Hunter is on the village team.**

  - name: Mason
    definition: |
      When using the Masons always put **both** Masons in the game.

      The Mason wakes up at night and looks for the other Mason. If the Mason doesn’t see another Mason, it means the other Mason card is in the center. **Masons are on the village team.**

  - name: Insomniac
    definition: |
      The Insomniac wakes up and looks at her card (to see if it has changed). Only use the Insomniac if the Robber and/or the Troublemaker are in the game. **The Insomniac is on the village team.**

  - name: Minion
    definition: |
      Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are. During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. The Werewolves don’t know who the Minion is. If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (not the Minion) dies. This role can be a very powerful ally for the werewolf team. **The Minion is on the werewolf team.**

  - name: Doppelgänger
    definition: |
      The Doppelgänger is a fairly complicated card, because she takes on the role and team of whatever card she views.

        The Doppelgänger wakes up before the other roles.

        At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one other player’s card and does the following based on what she sees: 

        **Villager, Tanner, Hunter:** She is now that role and does nothing else at night.

        **Werewolf or Mason:** She wakes up with the other Werewolves or Masons when they are called. She is on the werewolf team if she views a Werewolf, and is on the village team if she views a Mason.

        **Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk:** She immmediately does that role’s action (she does not wake up again with the original role when it is called).

        **Minion:** At the end of the Doppelgänger phase, the Announcer tells the Doppelgänger to close her eyes unless she is now the Minion, and that werewolves should put their thumbs up. She is on the werewolf team.

        **Insomniac:** After the Insomniac closes her eyes, the Doppelgänger-Insomniac is woken up to check her card to see if she is still the Doppelgänger.

        If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, she is the role the Doppelgänger originally viewed. The Doppelgänger’s script at night is a little different than most, as she has to be told to look for werewolves if she is the Minion, and is woken up later at night if the Insomniac is present.

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or a special character. It’s your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win... unless you’ve become a Werewolf yourself!

# Contents

* 3 Villagers
* 2 Werewolves
* 1 Seer
* 1 Robber
* 1 Troublemaker
* 1 Tanner
* 1 Drunk
* 1 Hunter
* 2 Masons
* 1 Insomniac
* 1 Minion
* 1 Doppelgänger 
* 16 Role Tokens

# Basic Setup

Setup differs based on the number of players (3-10).

For your first game, it’s recommended that you play a 3-5 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay (If you have more, don’t worry. The game is very quick and everyone else will enjoy watching).

Include the following cards:

| 3 Players                                                  | 4 Players   | 5 Players    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 2 Werewolves, 1 Seer, 1 Robber, 1 Troublemaker, 1 Villager | +1 Villager | +2 Villagers |

There should always be three more cards than the number of players. Shuffle the selected cards face down and deal one to each player. Put the remaining three cards and tokens that match all the cards being used in the middle of the table.

Each player should secretly view their card, and place it face down near the three cards in the center of the table. All players should be able to reach all cards easily.

# Night

There are several roles that are called on at night to do a night action. However, players with a Villager, Tanner, or Hunter card *never* wake up at night.

In addition to having a role card, one player is designated the Announcer and announces each of the roles in order and silently counts to ten after each role is woken up to allow the players with that role to perform their action at night. 

Use this script with the previously suggested cards: 

> Announcer: “Everyone, close your eyes.” 
> 
> *All players close their eyes (including the Announcer).*
> 
> “Werewolves, wake up and look for other werewolves.”
> 
> *The werewolves open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others).*
> 
> “Werewolves, close your eyes. Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.”
> 
> *The player with the Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one other player’s card or any two of the cards in the center.*
> 
> “Seer, close your eyes. Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player’s card, and then view your new card.” 
> 
> *The player with the Robber card opens his eyes and may quietly exchange his card for another player’s card, which he looks at.*
> 
> “Robber, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players.”
> 
> *The player with the Troublemaker card opens her eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two other players without looking at those cards.*
> 
> “Troublemaker, close your eyes.” 
> 
> *The Announcer, keeping his eyes closed, moves the cards around slightly (this ensures no one can claim a card was moved/inspected because it is no longer in its original position).*
> 
> “Everyone, Wake up!”
> 
> *All players open their eyes and look around suspiciously.*

At night, players who are not active (whose eyes are closed) may not move, point, or do anything to communicate with the active player(s).

# Day

After the night phase, players discuss amongst themselves who they believe the Werewolves are.

All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone. Werewolves might want to claim to be a different role so that they don’t die.

Because certain roles change other players’ cards, some players will believe they are one role, when they are actually a different one. After the night phase, your role is the card that is currently in front of you, which may be different than your original role. *No one may look at any cards after the night phase.*

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.

> “Everyone, three, two, one, VOTE!” 
> 
> *Each player points to another player.*

The player with the most votes dies and reveals his card. In case of a tie, all players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards.

If no player receives more than one vote, no one dies. One way the players might achieve this is if everyone votes in the same direction around the table, with each player receiving one vote (decide this as a group before you vote).

# Game End

After just one night and one day... 

The village team wins:

1) If at least one Werewolf dies. Even if one or more players who are not Werewolves die in addition to a Werewolf dying, everyone on the village team wins.

2) If no one is a Werewolf and no one dies.

It is possible for no one to be a Werewolf if all Werewolf cards are in the center.

The werewolf team only wins if at least one player is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.

If you are playing with the Tanner, there are special rules regarding who wins; see the Tanner’s role description for details.

# Announcer Tips

As the Announcer, place any tokens with numbers on them near you, and open your eyes in between roles if you need to check the night wake order. Otherwise keep your eyes closed during the night. You may want to tap on the table during the night to cover up any sounds made by the different players when they are looking at and moving cards. If you call your own role, don’t speak while performing your action.

When introducing players to the game for the first time, or introducing new roles, be sure to pause during the “action” section of each role you call to give players enough time to decide what to do and to complete their action.

# Get the Free App

Instead of having an Announcer, you can simply use the free app for mobile devices available at www.beziergames.com. This app calls out the roles you’re using in order, provides some background noise, and also has a timer for the day phase. You can even set it to move quickly once the players are comfortable with all the roles.

The app works on both Android and iOS devices and is completely free!

# Other Tips

The length of time it takes for discussion during the day phase is up to the players. With larger groups, you’ll need a bit more time than with smaller groups. After a few plays with a few larger groups, consider using a timer; when the timer goes off, everyone must vote. This adds a sense of urgency to the discussions, and will result in less non-relevant conversations during the day.

Playing with higher player numbers (7+) can make it difficult for everyone to reach the middle of the table. Standing at the table during the Night phase can make reaching easier, and using a smaller table can also help. If you have to use a long “banquet” table, try to position the players on the long sides of it, and not the ends.

# Tournament Play

Set up a mini tournament by providing the winners of each game with a poker chip or other small item. Once any player has obtained a specified number of chips, such as five, the player with the most chips wins. Continue playing if there is a tie until one player has the most chips.

For larger tournaments with multiple games, do a double-elimination style tournament, where players play until they have lost twice.

# Using Other Roles

You may use additional roles in your games beyond the basic setup. Just take out a card and replace it with a different one. You may use virtually any combination of cards, though you probably don’t want to introduce more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time, so players can easily understand them.

Regardless of which roles are present, you must always have 3 more cards than players.

Before each round, place a token that corresponds to each of the cards near the Announcer.

This way everyone will know what roles are in the game, and the Announcer will know in what order to call them.

Be creative in your role selection: Try having a single Werewolf, or shuffling all of the cards and dealing them out to players entirely randomly!

You can even create a village with no Villager cards... that way everyone has a special role.

# Roles That Wake Up at Night

These roles wake up at night in the following order (see the chart on the back page for a nice compressed list that’s easy to refer to). Within each of the role descriptions is a sample script which the Announcer may use:

## Doppelgänger

The Doppelgänger is a fairly complicated card, because she takes on the role and team of whatever card she views. If you haven’t played with most of the other roles yet, skip this section for now... it will make a lot more sense then.

The Doppelgänger wakes up before the other roles.

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one other player’s card and does the following based on what she sees: 

*Villager, Tanner, Hunter:* She is now that role and does nothing else at night.

*Werewolf or Mason:* She wakes up with the other Werewolves or Masons when they are called. She is on the werewolf team if she views a Werewolf, and is on the village team if she views a Mason.

*Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk:* She immediately does that role’s action (she does not wake up again with the original role when it is called).

*Minion:* At the end of the Doppelgänger phase, the Announcer tells the Doppelgänger to close her eyes unless she is now the Minion, and that werewolves should put their thumbs up. She is on the werewolf team.

*Insomniac:* After the Insomniac closes her eyes, the Doppelgänger-Insomniac is woken up to check her card to see if she is still the Doppelgänger.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, she is the role the Doppelgänger originally viewed. The Doppelgänger’s script at night is a little different than most, as she has to be told to look for werewolves if she is the Minion, and is woken up later at night if the Insomniac is present. Use the following script if there is no Minion in the game:

> “Doppelgänger, wake up and look at another player’s card. You are now that role. If your new role has a night action, do it now.”
>
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at one other player’s card. If the viewed card is the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, or Drunk, she does that action right now. If the viewed card is a Werewolf or Mason, she wakes up when those roles are called. If the viewed card is a Villager, Tanner or Hunter, she does nothing.*
>
> “Doppelgänger, close your eyes.”

If there is a Minion in the game, use this script: 

> “Doppelgänger, wake up and look at another player’s card. You are now that role. If your new role has a night action, do it now.”
> 
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at one other player’s card. If the viewed card is the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker or Drunk, she does that action right now. If the viewed card is a werewolf or Mason, she wakes up when those roles are called. If the viewed card is a Villager, Tanner or Hunter, she does nothing.*
> 
> “If you are now a Minion, keep your eyes open. Otherwise, close them. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Doppelgänger-Minion can see who you are.”
> 
> *If the Doppelgänger is a Minion, she keeps her eyes open; otherwise, she closes them.*
> 
> *The werewolves stick out a thumb for the Doppelgänger-Minion to see.*
> 
> “Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Doppelgänger, close your eyes.” 

If there is an Insomniac in the game, after the Insomniac has been called, use the following script:

> “Doppelgänger, if you viewed the Insomniac card, wake up and look at your card.” 
> 
> *The Doppelgänger opens her eyes and looks at her card to see if has changed during the night.*
> 
> “Doppelgänger, close your eyes.”

## Werewolf

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other werewolves. If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center. *Werewolves are on the werewolf team.*

> “Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.”
> 
> The Werewolves open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others).
> 
> “Werewolves, close your eyes.” 

*Lone Wolf Option:* If there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card. This is extremely beneficial to a Werewolf who doesn’t have a partner, and provides him with a useful tool for deceiving the rest of the players.

## Minion

Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are. During this phase, all Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see who they are. The Werewolves don’t know who the Minion is. If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves (and the Minion) win. If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one other player (not the Minion) dies. This role can be a very powerful ally for the werewolf team. *The Minion is on the werewolf team.*

> “Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.”
> 
> The Minion opens his eyes. The Werewolves stick out a thumb for the Minion to see. The Minions look around to see which players are Werewolves.
> 
> “Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.”

## Mason

When using the Masons always put *both* Masons in the game.

The Mason wakes up at night and looks for the other Mason. If the Mason doesn’t see another Mason, it means the other Mason card is in the center. *Masons are on the village team.*

> “Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.”
> 
> The Masons open their eyes and look for anyone else whose eyes are open (there might not be any others).
> 
> “Masons, close your eyes.” 

## Seer

At night, the Seer may look either at one other player’s card or at two of the center cards, but does not move them. *The Seer is on the village team.*

> “Seer, wake up. You may look at another player’s card or two of the center cards.” 
> 
> The player with the Seer card opens her eyes and may quietly look at one other player’s card or any two of the cards in the center.
> 
> “Seer, close your eyes.”

## Robber

At night, the Robber may choose to rob a card from another player and place his Robber card where the other card was. Then the Robber looks at his new card. The player who receives the Robber card is on the village team. *The Robber is on the team of the card he takes*, however, he does not do the action of his new role at night.

If the Robber chooses *not* to rob a card from another player, he remains the Robber and *is on the village team.*

> “Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player’s card, and then view your new card.”
> 
> The player with the Robber card opens his eyes and may quietly exchange his card for another player’s card, which he looks at.
> 
> “Robber, close your eyes.

## Troublemaker

At night, the Troublemaker may switch the cards of two *other* players without looking at those cards. The players who receive a different card are now the role (and team) of their new card, even though they don’t know what role that is until the end of the game. *The Troublemaker is on the village team.*

> “Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players.” 
> 
> The player with the Troublemaker card opens her eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two other players without looking at those cards.
> 
> “Troublemaker, close your eyes.”

## Drunk

The Drunk is so drunk that he doesn’t remember his role. When it comes time to wake up at night, he must exchange his Drunk card for any card in the center, but he does not look at it. The Drunk is now the new role in front of him (even though he doesn’t know what that new role is) and is on that team.

> “Drunk, wake up and exchange your card with a card from the center.” 
> 
> The player with the Drunk card opens his eyes and exchanges his card for one of the three center cards, but does not view his new card.
> 
> “Drunk, close your eyes.” 

## Insomniac

The Insomniac wakes up and looks at her card (to see if it has changed). Only use the Insomniac if the Robber and/or the Troublemaker are in the game. *The Insomniac is on the village team.*

> “Insomniac, wake up and look at your card.” 
> 
> The player with the Insomniac card opens her eyes and looks at her own card to see if it has changed during the night.
> 
> “Insomniac, close your eyes.” 

# No-Wake Roles

The following roles do not wake up at night: 

## Villager

The Villager has no special abilities, but he is definitely not a werewolf. Players may often claim to be a Villager. *The Villager is on the village team.*

## Tanner

The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die. The Tanner only wins if he dies. If the Tanner dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves do not win. If the Tanner dies and a Werewolf also dies, the village team wins too. The Tanner is considered a member of the village (but is not on their team), so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves are in the center, the village team loses. *The Tanner is not on the werewolf or the villager team.*

## Hunter

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes his target receives). *The Hunter is on the village team.*

# Using Role Tokens

One Night Ultimate Werewolf includes role tokens that match each of the cards. You can use these in a few different ways:

1. Display what roles are in play during each game: Put the roles that are being used face up near the center of the table, so everyone can see which roles (and how many of each) are in the current game. The numbers on the tokens correspond to the night wake order.

2. Randomly select the roles that are in each game: place the tokens in a bag and draw out the number of roles you need (the number of players plus three).

3. During the day phase of the game, players can use the tokens to help them deduce players’ roles by placing appropriate tokens on top of cards that they’ve “verified.”

# Night Wake Order

When playing with different roles, the order that the roles wake up at night is important. The following is a list of ALL the roles that are woken at night, and the order they should be woken relative to each other (only call the roles that are in your game):

1. Doppelgänger

2. Werewolves

3. Minion

4. Masons

5. Seer

6. Robber

7. Troublemaker

8. Drunk

9. Insomniac

10. Doppelgänger/Insomniac

The Villagers, the Tanner, and the Hunter are never woken up at night.
