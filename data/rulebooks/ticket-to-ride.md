# Summary

On a blustery autumn evening five old friends met in the backroom of one of the city’s oldest and most private clubs. Each had traveled a long distance — from all corners of the world — to meet on this very specific day... October 2, 1900 — 28 years to the day that the London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a £20,000 bet that he could travel *Around the World in 80 Days.* 

When the story of Fogg’s triumphant journey filled all the newspapers of the day, the five attended University together. Inspired by his impetuous gamble, and a few pints from the local pub, the group commemorated his circumnavigation with a more modest excursion and wager - a bottle of good claret to the first to make it to *Le Procope* in Paris. 

Each succeeding year, they met to celebrate the anniversary and pay tribute to Fogg. And each year a new expedition (always more difficult) with a new wager (always more expensive) was proposed. Now at the dawn of the century it was time for a new impossible journey. The stakes: $1 Million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see which of them could travel by rail to the most cities in North America — in just 7 days. The journey would begin immediately...

*Ticket to Ride* is a cross-country train adventure. Players compete to connect different cities by laying claim to railway routes on a map of North America.

# Setting up the Game

Place the board map in the center of the table. Each player takes a set of 45 Colored Train Cars along with its matching Scoring Marker. Each player places his Scoring Marker on Start on the Scoring Track running along the map’s border. Throughout the game, each time a player scores points, he will advance his marker accordingly.

Shuffle the Train Car cards and deal a starting hand of 4 cards to each player. Place the remaining deck of Train Car cards near the board and turn the top five cards from the deck face-up.

Place the Longest Path Bonus card face up next to the board.

Shuffle the Destination Ticket cards and deal 3 cards to each player. Each player looks at their Destination Tickets and decides which ones they wish to keep. A player must keep at least two, but may keep all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket deck. This deck is then placed next to the board. Players keep their Destination Tickets secret until the end of the game.

You are now ready to begin.

# Object of the Game

The object of the game is to score the highest number of total points. Points can be scored by:

* Claiming a Route between two adjacent cities on the map; 
* Successfully completing a Continuous Path of routes between two cities listed on your Destination Ticket(s); 
* Completing the Longest Continuous Path of routes.

Points are lost if you do not successfully complete the route given on the Destination Ticket(s) you kept.

# The Game Turn

The player who is the most experienced traveler goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, each player taking one turn at a time until the game ends. On his turn, a player must perform one (and only one) of the following three actions: 

## Draw Train Car Cards

The player may draw 2 Train Car cards. He may take any one of the face-up cards or he may draw the top card from the deck (this is a blind draw). If he draws a face up card, he immediately turns a replacement card face-up from the deck. He then draws his second card, either from the face up cards or from the top of the deck. (See [Train Car Cards](#train-car-cards) for special rules for Locomotive cards).

## Claim a Route

The player may claim a route on the board by playing a set of Train Car cards that match the color and length of the route and then placing one of his colored trains on each space of this route. He then records his score by moving his Scoring Marker the appropriate number of spaces (see [Route Scoring Table](#route-scoring-table)) along the Scoring Track on the board.

## Draw Destination Tickets

The player draws 3 Destination Tickets from the top of the deck. He must keep at least one of them, but he may keep two or all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.

# Train Car Cards

There are 8 types of regular Train Car cards, plus Locomotive cars. The colors of each type of Train Car card match various routes between cities on the board - Purple, Blue, Orange, White, Green, Yellow, Black, and Red.

Locomotives are Multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of cards when claiming a route. If a Locomotive card is one of the five face-up cards , the player who draws it may only draw one card, instead of two. If, after having drawn one card the replacement card is a Locomotive, the player cannot take it. If at any time, three of the five face-up cards are Locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded and five new ones are turned face-up to replace them.

> *Note:* If a player is lucky enough to get a Locomotive from the top of the deck in a blind draw, it stills counts as a single card and he may still draw a total of two cards that turn.

A player may have any number of cards in his hand at any time.

When the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled into a new draw pile deck. The cards should be shuffled thoroughly, since all the cards have been discarded in sets.

In the unlikely event that there are no cards left in the deck and there are no discards (because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), a player cannot draw Train Car cards. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards.

# Claiming Routes

To claim a route, a player must play a set of cards equal to the number of spaces in the route. A set of cards must be of the same type. Most routes require a specific type of set.

For example a Blue route must be claimed using blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Some routes - those that are Gray colored - can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.

When a route is claimed, the player places one of his plastic trains in each of the spaces of the route. All the cards in the set used to claim the route are then discarded.

A player may claim any open route on the board. He is never required to connect to any of his previously played routes. A player may only claim a maximum of one route, hence connect two adjacent cities, never more, on his turn.

Some cities are connected by *Double-Routes*. One player cannot claim both routes to the same cities.

> ***Important Note:* In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the Double-Routes can be used. A player can claim either of the two routes between cities, but the other route is then closed to other players.**


# Route Scoring Table

When a player claims a route, he records the points he receives by moving his Scoring Marker on the Scoring Track: 

| Route Length | Points Scored |
|--------------|---------------|
| 1            | 1             |
| 2            | 2             |
| 3            | 4             |
| 4            | 7             |
| 5            | 10            |
| 6            | 15            |

# Drawing Destination Ticket Cards

A player can use his turn to draw more Destination Ticket cards. To do so, he draws 3 new cards from the top of the Destination Ticket Deck. He must keep at least one of the cards, but may also keep two or all three if he chooses. If there are less than 3 Destination Tickets left in the deck, the player only draws the cards that are available. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket Deck.

Each Destination Ticket includes the name of two cities on the map and a Point Value. If a player successfully completes a series of routes that connect the two cities, they will *add* the amount of points indicated on the Destination Ticket to their point totals at the end of the game. If they do not successfully connect the two cities, they *deduct* the amount of points indicated.

Destination Tickets are kept secret from other players until the game's final scoring. A player may have any number of Destination Ticket cards during the game.

# Game End

When one player’s stock of colored plastic trains gets down to only 0,1 or 2 trains left at the end of his turn, each player, including that player, gets one final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores.

# Calculating Scores

Players should have already accounted for the points earned as they completed different routes. To make sure no mistakes were made, you may want to re-count the points for each player’s routes.

Players should then reveal all their Destination Tickets and add (or subtract) the value of their Destination Tickets still in hand, based on whether they successfully (or not) connected those cities together.

The player who has the Longest Continuous Path of routes receives this special bonus card and adds 10 points to his score. When evaluating and comparing path lengths, only take into account continuous lines of plastic trains of the same color. A continuous path may include loops, and pass through the same city several times, but a given plastic train may never be used twice in the same continuous path. In the case of a tie for the longest path, all tied players score the 10 point bonus.

The player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players are tied for the most points, the player who has completed the most Destination Tickets wins. In the unlikely event that they are still tied, the player with the Longest Continuous Path card wins.
