# Object

Collect the most points by beheading important nobles. Play is divided into **three days**.

# Setup

Shuffle the **Noble deck** and the **Action deck** separately and deal **5 action cards** to each player.

# Play

At the beginning of the first day, place the top **12 cards from the noble deck face up in a line from left to right**.

The right end is where the guillotine is, where nobles will be beheaded (collected).

Randomly choose a starting player. Their turn proceeds as follows:

## Play an action card (optional)

Action cards allow you to move nobles forward and backward in line, draw extra cards, add or remove nobles from line, get extra points, etc.

## Collect the first noble in line

Nobles are worth various points. When you collect a noble place it face up in front of you to make a score pile.

## Draw an action card (whether or not you played one)

The next player to the left takes a turn, and so on.

Play continues until there are no nobles left in line at the start of someone’s turn. That day is then over and a new day begins: deal out 12 new noble cards from the noble deck.

All players keep their remaining action cards and any noble cards they’ve collected. The player to the left of the person who started the previous day is the first player for the new day.

Other players may see how many points you’ve scored.

When the third day is over, players count up their points and any action cards that might add to or subtract from the total.

**Whoever has the most points wins.**
